# Steps Window Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This React app manages steps using useState, guiding users through a three-step process. The app displays a step number and corresponding message, allowing navigation between steps using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. If the step is at 1 or 3, it restricts the navigation to avoid invalid step numbers. The buttons are rendered as reusable components that accept customizable colors and display dynamic content through the children prop. The app also has a toggle button to open and close the step section.
